## Abstract

To set a limit for the boundless online payments & expenditures have always arisen in our lives. We therefore bring an expenditure
calculator “SpendEx” that can take the total net banking expenditures of the user.
In addition to the online payments, it also allows the user to add cash payment bills that can also be taken into account.
Monthly limits can be set up to remind if it exceeds or not. 
The user should be able to view their estimated expenditures whenever needed.
From the user’s point of view, it asks the user for their current monthly earnings & also asks for an expected budget. The overall expenditures including the
net banking & added bills of rent… will be taken into calculation. Hence, providing the estimation of their expenditure & also showing a display of the closeness of the monthly target.
